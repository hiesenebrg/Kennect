Question 1 - what is JWT?
 Answer - JWT stands for JSON Web-Token .
          JWT  are most commonly used to identify an authenticated user.
         They are issued by an authentication server and are consumed by the client-server (to secure its APIs). 

Question 2 - Advantages of JWT
Answer - These are three advantages of JWT
1. JWTs are a standardized container format to encode user and client related information in a secure way.
2. JWTs are not restricted to present session-like information about the authenticated user itself; they can also be used to delegate access to clients that act on behalf of the user
3. JWTs allow for a more access model than cookies because JWTs can be limited in "scope" (what they allow the client to do) as well as time
